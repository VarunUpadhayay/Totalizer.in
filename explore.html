               <p style="color:white;" class="text-center p-2" id="hi">BMI is a measurement of a person's leanness or corpulence based on their height and weight, and is intended to quantify tissue mass. It is widely used as a general indicator of whether a person has a healthy body weight for their height.  <!-- These ranges of BMI vary based on factors such as region and age, and are sometimes further divided into subcategories such as severely underweight or very severely obese. Being overweight or underweight can have significant health effects, so while BMI is an imperfect measure of healthy body weight, it is a useful indicator of whether any additional testing or action is required. Refer to the table below to see the different categories based on BMI that is used by the calculator. -->

        A tip or gratuity is an extra sum of money paid to certain service workers for a provided service. Tip amounts, as well as acceptance, vary in different parts of the world. In some countries in East Asia such as Japan, tips are seen as insulting and can sometimes be interpreted as a bribe. I  <!-- As such, as a tourist, it can be helpful to research the tipping customs in the countries being visited. In the U.S. or any other country where tipping is expected, depending on the restaurant or the number of patrons at a table, gratuity may be automatically applied to the bill amount. As previously mentioned, tipping can be offensive in some countries, so although a citizen of the United States that is visiting another country may want to express their appreciation of the service provided, the gesture may in some cases result in the opposite effect. -->

               <p style="color:white;" class="text-center p-2 ">A scientific calculator is a type of electronic calculator, usually but not always handheld, designed to calculate problems in science, engineering, and mathematics. They have completely replaced slide rules in traditional applications, and are widely used in both education and professional settings.<!-- In certain contexts such as higher education, scientific calculators have been superseded by graphing calculators, which offer a superset of scientific calculator functionality along with the ability to graph input data and write and store programs for the device.  -->
